# Did the Extreme Events of Solar Flux Cause Any Harm to Earth in Recent Years?
The solar wind is a stream of charged particles emitted from corona towards all directions. Extreme high level of flux can cause communication disruptions, radiation exposure and many other catastrophes to human society, so we will focus on extreme events in following study. First we collected the data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) including variables year, month, day, time and flux measured by two sensors. This time series data was measured at approximately a two-second sampling rate, and we only used data from 2017 and 2019 for our analysis.

The X-ray flux is measured in watts per square meter and scientists classify the brightness of solar flux into four levels. B class flares have strength peak less than 1e-6, which is too small to cause any harm to us. Flares of class C and M have strength peak in the range (1e-6,1e-5) and (1e-5,1e-4) and may have some minor consequences. Flares having strength peak more than 1e-4 belong to class X and have the most potential of damage like power out. Though the fluxes from two sensors have similar patterns as we can see from the following study, combining them together can be more informative to our analysis.

After preprocessing and cleaning the data, we wanted to make several time series plots of flux against the day of year. We can observe a peak of flux around the 250th day in 2017, while the level of flux stayed below the level of X class in other days, and most of the time below M level. In 2019, the flux levels were all below C level except the 125th day, so the solar fluxes of 2019 were much milder than that of 2017. However, the raw scale is not evenly spaced, we can hardly observe the details of solar flux patterns below the X level. Moreover, sometimes we not only want to detect a very bright flux, but also need to find time that fluxes are profoundly higher than days before and after it.  

To address the problem above, we transformed the flux data with log function and made the same plots. According to the flux plot in 2017, the peak of solar flux tended to have a recurrent pattern about a 50-day cycle, though they did not cause any consequential events. We can also find that the peaking of flux lasted around 5 days rather than just a single day. So once a storm gets going on the surface of the sun, it can produce one of these mass ejections, and then we might observe a series of additional ones for the next few days. With the log transformation, more flux events are detectable even if they are way below the consequential level.

For the year 2019, the flux displayed a certain mode from the beginning of the year until the 125th day (April) with occasional bursts, and then it entered into a very quiescent state around day 140 and remained that state for the rest of the year. But we can predict that the quiescent state will end after 2019 and the solar flux may reenter into a dynamic behavior due to the recurrent pattern of flux. Though the solar wind did not cause any significant harm to the earth according to the data till today in recent few years.

Next we wanted to check the autocorrelation of the solar flux. Since we didn’t have gridded data and the distribution was extremely heavy tailed according to the tail plot, we would like to use the Kendall’s Tau autocorrelation, which is more robust than classic autocorrelation. If we plot around 1,100 quantiles of the curves representing the Kendall’s Tau autocorrelation against time lag (measured in minutes), we can find a mass diversity of autocorrelation functions though they all displayed the behavior of exponential decline, indicating our time series data was non-stationary. Within the first minute the autocorrelation was not so weak but started to drop pretty fast after that. It is notable that the mean curve was higher than the median, making it clear that at any given minute and lag, the Kendall’s Tau autocorrelation values were right skewed.

We also wanted to draw the mean autocorrelation against time lags, along with the mean plus or minus one standard deviation in PC direction, for the top three principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC3) of our data. It is obvious that PC1 just elevated all of the autocorrelations. Whether we have a positive or negative PC1 score, we either get uniformly higher or lower autocorrelations throughout all the time values plotted. However, PC2 scores gave us a higher autocorrelation at short time lags and lower one at long time lags in one direction, and give us a lower autocorrelation at short time lags and higher one at long time lags in the other direction.

Then we could do some principal component analysis based on the PC factor scores versus time (measured in days) plots. We were able to get a bit more insight of the non-stationary dynamics of our time series data from these plots. For PC1, the scores were negative at first, then they reached zero and went back to negative, next they became quite positive and so on and so forth. There are some months that the factor one scores are uniformly very strong (March, August) and months scores mostly negative (January, December), which would give us an intuition that how the autocorrelation functions look like. For the PC2 and PC3, the smoothed curves just had mild changes within the year and did not fluctuate strongly like PC1 curves.

It is essential for the government and scientist to understand the dynamics of the sun and predict the space weather events which can cause catastrophic damage to our planet. For example, they can reinforce the infrastructures not robust enough to withstand a high-level solar flux. It also helps if people can shut down sensitive equipment, adjust voltage levels and redistributing loads before such extreme events. These precautions may save a lot of money and lives if scientists can predict the space weather events just a few minutes in advance.

There are also some limitations to our study. First we just examined the data from 2017 and 2019, so we had no information of solar flux in other years, which might be inadequate for us to answer whether the solar wind has caused some catastrophic damage, though we can know from historical data that there haven’t been any damaging events related to solar wind in almost 20 years. Second the size of our data set was not large enough to draw some conclusions about the periodical patterns of solar flux. We were not able to find multi-year or multi-decade cycles in our data.
